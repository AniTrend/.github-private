# Welcome to AniTrend

**AniTrend** started off as a standalone application and this organisation was created to share some of the amazing in-house solutions we have came up with to solve some challenges we faced. Sharing is caring and we'd encourage others to contribute, in any form. If you use any of the libraries feel free to suggest features, changes, improvements e.t.c via issues and/or pull requests, also see some links to support our projects
